# local-nodejs
Simple configuration for local NodeJS development.

Run `docker-compose up` command to build the solution.

You can then access the local server by visiting `localhost:3000` and to view the additional endpoint you can visit `localhost:3000/api/hello`

After making changes to the configurations make sure to run `docker-compose up -d --build` to rebuild and make sure its updated.
